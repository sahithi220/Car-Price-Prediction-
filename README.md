🚗 Car Price Prediction
End-to-end Machine Learning project predicting used car prices using regression and a web app.

🏎 Car Price Prediction
This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on multiple features such as year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. It covers the full ML workflow—from data preprocessing and model training to deployment in an interactive web application.

🚀 Tech Stack
Python
Pandas / NumPy
Scikit-learn
Flask / Streamlit
HTML / CSS / JavaScript (if using Flask for frontend)
📊 Features
Cleans and processes car dataset
Builds a Random Forest regression model
Serves predictions through a web app
Handles categorical encoding and feature scaling automatically

🧠 What I Learned
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Training, evaluating, and saving machine learning models (Pickle / Joblib)
Integrating ML models with web applications for interactive predictions
